# 🤖 R2-D2 & C-3PO Talk — FoundationModels Test App

This is a **test application** built using Apple’s new **FoundationModels** framework. The project features a unique dialogue between two iconic droids — **R2-D2** and **C-3PO** — discussing a topic of your choice.

## 🧠 What It Does

You simply provide an initial topic, and the two droids will carry out a continuous conversation, exploring and debating the subject with their own personalities and perspectives.

This app is a playful experiment designed to demonstrate the capabilities of FoundationModels and multi-agent conversation logic using natural language generation.
